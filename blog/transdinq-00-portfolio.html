<p>I am venturing out in the world of web creation.
I have dabbled in it before by using <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>. And yes, the templates make it easy to built a site, but they always seem to block me from customizing the page the way I think I should be able to.  In WordPress&#39;s defense, I simply did not know enough about HTML, CSS and other related foreign abbreviations to make the changes I desired.</p>
<p>That is about to change my friend .... I have decided to take the painful  path of creating a custom website from scratch. By taking this route, my portfolio will not be an instant entity, instead it will become a journey and another project for year 2 of <a href="http://aut.ac.nz/study-at-aut/study-areas/creative-technologies/bachelor-of-creative-technologies">BCT</a>. </p>
<p>Luckily I have the best sidekick in the world to mentor me and help me out along the way. He scratches my back while I scratch his. I introduce him to our new technology briefs and adventures and he helps me out  understanding and implementing them whenever he can as he learns about them along the way (at 4x the speed I do).  If we ever want to achieve &quot;Effective Team&quot; status, I have to at least sound like I know what I am talking about :).</p>
<p>It is my goal to write this journal in such a way that I will be able to easily reference back for my own benefit as well as the benefit of other people who want to venture out in web building.</p>

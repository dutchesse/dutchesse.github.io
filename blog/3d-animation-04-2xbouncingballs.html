<p>Trying to get 2 balls to interact with each other without the physics function is not easy.
Maya has physics functions that simulates the real world and lets you interact objects fairly accurately, but for the sake of &quot;getting a real feel of timing/spacing&quot; our assignment is to make these balls interact from scratch.</p>
<p>I can see why animation movies can take anywhere form 2 to 3 years to make. It is the same repetitive exercise - move things a bit and hit play to see if it looks accurate.</p>
<p>There are some reference files on line of people dropping various balls and once played in slow-mo speed it is a big help. Nevertheless, I have spend all day Sunday fiddling with 2 balls and am still not happy. It does not help that my laptop is getting less and less responsive ... can&#39;t wait till the 12th till my new Boxx monster arrives.</p>

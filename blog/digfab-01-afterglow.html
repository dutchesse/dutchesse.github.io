<p>James is back, apparently he had a little Tiki Tour type sabatical over hte last couple of months and had spend some time in various places in Europe.
Good to have him back :)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.transmediale.de/">Afterglow</a> was a conference held in Berlin in January of this year.
It revolved around the Digital Revolution and its aftermath. It was argued that we now have reached post digital status and have to deal with the remains of the digital revolution. Can we really consider ourselves in a post-digital era already though? Personally I&#39;d argue we are still well in the midst of it ...</p>

<h3 id="excitement-">Excitement!</h3>
<p> ... so hard to sketch an excited person as  the entire action happens in such a quick amount of time. There are so many various ways in which excitement is expressed but it is often hard to find a real life person modeling you their excited pose. So .... the trusty internet to the rescue ... let&#x27;s look up some &quot;excited&quot; images.</p>
<p>It could be just my imagination but (with genuine excitement, not asked to pose) it seems kids often pull &quot;inward&quot; when excited, they pull their hands/arms and/or objects near their body and especially their faces as if they can&#x27;t believe what just happened. </p>
<p>The most extreme sincere &quot;outward&quot; excited poses are often found in sports right after the winning point is scored. It seems the outward motion of  excitement comes from self confidence, they go in believing they can win and the outward excitement is an explosion of confirmation and built up energy.</p>
<p>Even after studying several images next to each other it seems that even in the adult world &quot;hands to the face&quot; expresses &quot;I can&#x27;t believe it&quot; while fist pumps seem to translate &quot;yes, I knew I could do it !&quot; .   </p>

      <h1 id="intro-to-3d-animation">Intro to 3D Animation</h1>
<h2 id="march-19-2014">March 19, 2014</h2>
<h3 id="bouncing-a-ball-not-as-easy-as-it-sounds">Bouncing a ball, not as easy as it sounds</h3>
<p><strong>First step, getting the ball to bounce up/down</strong>   </p>
<ul>
<li>Create a sphere  </li>
<li>Set time line to 100/100  </li>
<li>move to starting point &gt; select key frame 1, hit &quot;s&quot;  </li>
<li>move ball up &gt; select key frame 12, hit &quot;s&quot;   </li>
<li>move ball down &gt; select key frame 24, hit &quot;s&quot;  </li>
<li>move ball up &gt; select key frame 36, hit &quot;s&quot;   </li>
<li>move ball down &gt; select key frame 48, hit &quot;s&quot;   </li>
<li>move ball up &gt; select key frame 60, hit &quot;s&quot;   </li>
<li>move ball down &gt; select key frame 72, hit &quot;s&quot;   </li>
<li>move ball up &gt; select key frame 84, hit &quot;s&quot;   </li>
<li>move ball down &gt; select key frame 96, hit &quot;s&quot;    </li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure the time line is set to playback speed &quot;real Time&quot;. Hit play and you&#x27;ll see the ball move up and down.</p>
<p><strong>Second step, getting the ball to move from left to right while bouncing</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>Window &gt; Animation Editors &gt; Graph Editor  </li>
<li>Re-size window, hit F to center entire graph</li>
<li>Select &quot;Translate Y&quot; to control the up/down motion</li>
</ul>
<p>Select last frame &gt; move the ball over to the right as far as you want it to go and set key again.
Now ball moves form left to right.</p>
<p>Great now I have a basic ball moving up/down &amp; left/right. Just need to make it more natural by studying some ball bounce reference movies.</p>

<h3 id="story-telling">Story Telling</h3>
<p>The team got together again this morning. After Maggie&#x27;s comments yesterday we all felt empty again. This happens every time we talk with certain faculty members; we finally cook up an idea around the given Studio Theme only to have it shattered as being too predictable or too assumable, which in turns means all ideas supporting the initial idea are unhinged as well (no wonder we all end up with blank faces after such a session).  </p>
<p>My main struggle so far with storytelling is that that as a group we have plenty of ideas ... it just always seems to be missing something ... &quot;something&quot; that makes me want to read a book or watch a movie. We never seem to be able to come up with a complete the story. </p>
<p>I searched to see if I could discover the art of Story telling and ran into this TED video by Film maker Andrew Stanton (&quot;Toy Story,&quot; &quot;WALL-E&quot;) In this video he shares what he knows about storytelling â€” starting at the end and working back to the beginning. I think he had some great remarks and what struck me as well is that it took them a year to come up with the story for Toy Story. These blockbusters simply do not get made within 4 weeks. &lt;<a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/andrew_stanton_the_clues_to_a_great_story&amp;gt">http://www.ted.com/talks/andrew_stanton_the_clues_to_a_great_story&amp;gt</a>;. </p>
<p>Ann Marie mentioned trees and happy thoughts. I remember we had a short story book  titled &quot;The giving tree&quot; by Shel Silverstein. I brought it in with the idea that we perhaps could re-tell an existing story but put our own spin on it. We toyed around with that idea and searched to see if we could find such a story but to no avail. So in the end we came back to our &quot;Ghost of place&quot; theme that we all connected to.</p>

<h3 id="creating-the-bct-2-portfolio">Creating the <a href="http://aut.ac.nz/study-at-aut/study-areas/creative-technologies/bachelor-of-creative-technologies">BCT</a> Portfolio</h3>
<p>I am venturing out in the world of web creation.
I have dabbled in it before by using <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>. And yes, the templates make it easy to built a site, but they always seem to block me from customizing the page the way I think I should be able to.  In WordPress&#x27;s defense, I simply did not know enough about HTML, CSS and other related foreign abbreviations to make the changes I desired.</p>
<p>That is about to change my friend .... I have decided to take the painful  path of creating a custom website from scratch. By taking this route, my portfolio will not be an instant entity, instead it will become a journey and another project for year 2 of <a href="http://aut.ac.nz/study-at-aut/study-areas/creative-technologies/bachelor-of-creative-technologies">BCT</a>. </p>
<p>Luckily I have the best sidekick in the world to mentor me and help me out along the way. He scratches my back while I scratch his. I introduce him to our new technology briefs and adventures and he helps me out  understanding and implementing them whenever he can as he learns about them along the way (at 4x the speed I do).  If we ever want to achieve &quot;Effective Team&quot; status, I have to at least sound like I know what I am talking about :).</p>
<p>It is my goal to write this journal in such a way that I will be able to easily reference back for my own benefit as well as the benefit of other people who want to venture out in web building.</p>

<p>There is a small change of plan ...
Having 4 papers this semester, time is a precious commodity. After some web cruising for layout ideas, I stumbled upon a blogging platform site called <a href="https://ghost.org/">ghost</a>. Similar to WordPress but as the creator explains &quot;just for blogging&quot;. As I like <a href="https://ghost.org/features/">the ideals</a> of this not-for-profit company, not to mention I get to escape the elementary world of Tumblr. I purchased the template <a href="http://dragonfly-v4.sunflowertheme.com/">Dragonfly</a> so I have access to the HTML/CSS</p>
<p>Ghost has many templates and yet again, here I found several templates of which certain items appeal to me, just not all neatly packaged into one, so .... I will start out with a template that struck me the most and will attempt by playing around to see if I can change it over time to create &quot;my&quot; perfect template.</p>

What I like about the Dragonfly template is the image and static text on the left and the blocks on the right. Every Paper will have it&#39;s own page with an image and text associated. </p>
<h5 id="glampagne">Glampagne</h5>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/Y6PjdMs.jpg" alt="Glampagne">
What I like about the Glampagne template is the neatly stacked squares. As I intend to create a page &amp; blog for each individual Uni paper, I imagine having it nice and neatly ordered with a picture, will make it easy to find previous blogs.</p>
